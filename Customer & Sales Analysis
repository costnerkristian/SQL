##This analysis is based on a dataset from a digital media store, represented by tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
I explored customer behavior, sales agent performance, and purchasing trends by analyzing invoices, track preferences, and total sales.
The insights derived from these queries provide a comprehensive understanding of customer purchasing habits and sales dynamics within the store.
